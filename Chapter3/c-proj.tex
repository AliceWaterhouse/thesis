\chapter{Para--$c$--projective compactification of $(M,g,\Omega)$} \label{chap:c-proj}
In \cite{CG} the concept of $c$--projective compactification was
defined. It is based on almost $c$--projective geometry \cite{c_proj},
an analogue of projective geometry defined for almost complex
manifolds, i.e., even--dimensional manifolds $M$ carrying a smooth endomorphism $J$ of $TM$ which satisfies $J^2=-Id$. In $c$--projective geometry, the equivalence class of torsion--free connections is replaced by an equivalence class of connections which are adapted to the almost complex structure $J$ in a natural way. In this chapter we discuss a notion of compactification which is modified to the {\it{``para''}} case, i.e. where the endomorphism $J$ squares to $Id$ rather than $-Id$. We show that the natural almost para--complex structure $J$ on any manifold $M$ arising in the projective to Einstein correspondence admits a type of compactification which we call \textit{para}--$c$--projective. The content of this chapter is based on material appearing in \cite{DGW}.

\section{Background and definitions}

\subsection{Almost (para--)complex geometry}

The purpose of this section is to introduce the definitions which are required to state the main results of \cite{CG}.

\begin{defi}
The Nijenhuis tensor of an endomorphism $J$ of $TM$ is defined by
\be \label{eq:Nijenhuis_def}
\mathcal{N}(X,Y):=[X,Y] - [JX,JY] + J([JX,Y] + [X,JY]),
\ee
where $X,Y$ are vector fields on $M$ and $[\cdot\,,\cdot]$ denotes the Lie bracket of vector fields. This is equivalent to
\be \label{eq:Nijenhuis_index_def}
\mathcal{N}^a_{bc}=J^d_{\ [b}\p_{|d|}J^a_{\ c]}-J^d_{\ [b}\p_{c]}J^a_{\ d}.
\ee
\end{defi}

Let $M$ be a complex manifold of (complex) dimension $n$, in the sense of having complex coordinates and complex transition functions. Then multiplication of the coordinates by $i$ defines an endomorphism $J$ of $TM$ which squares to $-Id$, so complex manifolds are a subset of almost complex manifolds. In this case, $J$ has eigenvalues $\pm i$, and the corresponding splitting of $TM$ into eigen--bundles is Frobenius integrable, meaning each of the two sub--bundles is tangent to a foliation of sub--manifolds of real dimension $n$ at every point. The Newlander--Nirenberg theorem describes complex manifolds in terms of the Nijenhuis tensor (\ref{eq:Nijenhuis_def}).

\begin{theo}[\cite{CG}]
An almost complex manifold $(M,J)$ is a complex manifold if and only if the Nijenhuis tensor of $J$ vanishes. In this case, we call the almost complex structure $J$ integrable.
\end{theo}


An endomorphism $J$ which squares to $Id$ defines an analogous splitting of the tangent bundle into sub--bundles with eigenvalues $\pm 1$, and this splitting is also Frobenius integrable if and only if the Nijenhuis tensor of $J$ vanishes. We thus call an almost para--complex structure $J$ with vanishing Nijenhuis tensor a para--complex structure, and say that in this case $J$ is integrable. In all the definitions below, the word \textit{almost} can be removed if the (para--)complex structure $J$ is integrable.

\subsection{Metrics and connections}

\begin{defi}
A (para--)Hermitian metric on an almost (para--)complex manifold $(M,J)$ is a metric $g$ satisfying
\[
g(J\cdot\,,J\cdot) = g(\cdot\,,\cdot).
\]
The triple $(M,J,g)$ then defines an almost (para--)Hermitian manifold.
\end{defi}

Note that every (para--)Hermitian manifold has a naturally defined two--form $\Omega(\cdot\,,\cdot)=g(J\cdot\,,\cdot)$, and can alternatively be specified as $(M,J,\Omega)$ or $(M,g,\Omega)$. An almost (para--)K\"ahler manifold $(M,J,g)$ is a (para--)Hermitian manifold whose associated two--form is closed, meaning $M$ carries compatible complex, pseudo--Riemannian and symplectic structures. The manifolds $M$ arising in the projective to Einstein correspondence are almost para--K\"ahler, and para--K\"ahler when the underlying projective structure is flat \cite{DM}.

\begin{defi}
A connection on an almost (para--)complex manifold $(M,J)$ is called complex if it preserves $J$.
\end{defi}

Note that, in contrast to a metric connection, it is not always possible to define a complex connection which is torsion--free. In fact, this is possible if and only if the Nijenhuis tensor (\ref{eq:Nijenhuis_def}) of $J$ vanishes. However, one can always define a complex connection whose torsion is equal to the Nijenhuis tensor of $J$ up to a constant multiplicative factor \cite{c_proj}. Such connections are called \textit{minimal}.

\subsection{(Para--)$c$--projective geometry}

\begin{defi}
Two affine connections $\nabla$ and $\ol{\nabla}$ on an almost (para--)complex manifold $(M,J)$ are called (para--)$c$--projectively equivalent if there is a one--form $\Upsilon_a$ on $M$ such that their components $\Gamma^a_{bc}$ and $\ol{\Gamma}^a_{bc}$ are related by
\be \label{eq:c-proj_change}
\ol{\Gamma}^a_{bc} - \Gamma^a_{bc} = \delta_{b}^{a}\Upsilon_{c}+\delta_{c}^{a}\Upsilon_{b} \pm (\Upsilon_d J^d_{\ b} J^a_{\ c} + \Upsilon_d J^d_{\ c} J^a_{\ b}),
\ee
where the $+$ corresponds to the case $J^2=Id$ and the $-$ corresponds to the case $J^2=-Id$.
\end{defi}

Note that the para--$c$--projective change of connection differs from the $c$--projective case in the signs of some of the terms, to account for the fact that $J$ squares to the $Id$ rather than $-Id$. It is easy to show that if $\nabla$ is complex then so is $\ol{\nabla}$, and the index symmetry of the right hand side of (\ref{eq:c-proj_change}) means that if $\nabla$ is minimal then so is $\ol{\nabla}$. An almost (para--)$c$--projective structure on a manifold $M$ comprises an almost (para--)complex structure $J$ and a (para--)$c$--projective equivalence class $[\nabla]$ of complex minimal connections.


\subsection{Para--$c$--projective compactification}

We now specialise to the ``para'' case, where $J^2=Id$. Note that all the corresponding results for $J^2=-Id$ can be found in the original paper \cite{CG}.

\begin{defi}
\label{defi_1}  Let $(M,J)$ be an almost para--complex manifold, and let $\nabla$ be a complex minimal connection. The structure $(M,J)$ admits a para--$c$--projective compactification to a manifold with boundary $\ol{M}=M\cup\p M$
if there exists a function $T:\ol{M}\rightarrow \R$ such that $\mathcal{Z}(T)$ is the boundary
$\p M\subset \ol{M}$, the differential $dT$ does not vanish on $\p M$, and the connection $\ol{\nabla}$ related to $\nabla$ by (\ref{eq:c-proj_change}) with $\Upsilon = dT/(2T)$ extends to $\ol{M}$.
\end{defi}



It follows easily from this definition that the endomorphism $J$ on $M$ naturally extends to all of $\ol{M}$ by parallel transport with respect to $\ol{\nabla}$. It thus defines an almost para--CR structure on the hypersurface distribution $\mathcal{D}$ defined by $\mathcal{D}_x:=T_x\p M \cap J(T_x \p M)$ for all $x\in\p M$. It can be shown (see Lemma 5 of \cite{CG} and modify to the case $J^2=Id$) that this almost para--CR structure is non--degenerate if and only if for any local defining function $T$ the one--form $\theta=dT\circ J$ restricts to a contact form on $\p M$.

\mynote{Need to define CR structure, degeneracy of a CR structure and contact form. I am a bit confused because a contact form requires complete non--integrability of the hypersurface distribution, but \cite{CG} is saying that Nijenhuis taking asymptotically tangential values means the boundary structure is partially integrable.}

Although $c$--projective compactification is defined for any almost complex manifold, the definition can be applied to pseudo--Riemannian metrics $g$ which are Hermitian with respect to the almost complex structure so long as there exists a connection which preserves both $g$ and $J$ and has minimal torsion. Such Hermitian metrics are said to be \textit{admissible}.  Note that such a connection, if it exists, is uniquely defined, since the conditions that it be complex and minimal determine its torsion. It is thus given by the Levi--Civita connection of $g$ plus a constant multiple of the Nijenhuis tensor (\ref{eq:Nijenhuis_def}) of $J$.

The first main result of \cite{CG} is  Theorem 8 in this reference, which gives a local form for an admissible Hermitian metric which is sufficient for the corresponding $c$--projective structure to be $c$--projectively compact. The theorem is stated below, adapted to the para--$c$--projective case. Note that this includes an assumption that the Nijenhuis tensor (\ref{eq:Nijenhuis_def}) of $J$ takes so--called \textit{asymptotically tangential values}. This is equivalent to the following statement in index notation:
\be
\label{Nijenhuis_condition}
\Big({\mathcal{N}^{a}}_{bc}\nabla_a T\Big)\Big|_{T=0}=0.  \ee
The
following result arises by a trivial adaption of the arguments in
\cite{CG} for the para--complex case, and so further details may be obtained from that source.

\begin{theo}[\cite{CG}] \label{CGthm}
Let $\ol{M}$ be a smooth manifold with boundary $\p M$ and interior $M$. Let $J$ be an almost para--complex structure on $\ol{M}$, such that $\p M$ is non--degenerate and the Nijenhuis tensor $\mathcal{N}$ of $J$ has asymptotically tangential values. Let $g$ be an admissible pseudo--Riemannian Hermitian metric on $M$. For a local defining function $T$ for the boundary defined on an open 
subset ${\mathcal U}\subset \ol{M}$, put $\theta=dT\circ J$ and, given a non--zero real 
constant $C$, define a Hermitian tensor field $h_{T,C}$ on 
${\mathcal U}\cap M$ by
\[
h_{T,C}:=Tg+\frac{C}{T}(dT^2-\theta^2).
\]
Suppose that for each $x\in\p M$ there is an open neighbourhood 
${\mathcal{U}}$ of $x$ in $\ol{M}$, a local defining function $T$ defined on 
${\mathcal{U}}$, and a non--zero constant $C$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $h_{T,C}$ admits a smooth extension to all of $\mathcal{U}$
\item for all vector fields $X,Y$ on $U$ with $dT(Y)=\theta(Y)=0$, the function $h_{T,C}(X,JY)$ approaches $Cd\theta(X,Y)$ at the boundary.
\end{itemize}
Then $g$ is $c$--projectively compact.
\end{theo}
Note that the statement in  Theorem \ref{CGthm} does not depend on the choice of $T$. Different choices of $T$ result in rescalings of the contact form $\theta$ on the boundary by a nowhere vanishing function.


\section{Compactifying the Dunajski--Mettler Class} 

In section \ref{sec:trac_construction} it was shown that the manifolds $M$ arising in the projective to Einstein correspondence can be identified with the projectivised cotractor bundle of $N$ where the zero locus of the canonical density $\tau$ has been removed. In the special case where $N=\RP^n$, and $[\nabla]$ is projectively flat the manifold $M=SL(n+1, \R)/GL(n, \R)$ can be identified with the projection of $\R^{n+1}\times \R_{n+1}\setminus {\mathcal Z}$, where ${\mathcal Z}$ denotes the set of incident pairs (point, hyperplane). \mynote{Need to decide what to do with the model via orbit decomp section to know what to do with this.}

The compactification procedure described in  
the theorem \ref{our_thm} below will, for the model, attach these incident pairs back to $M$, and more generally (in case of a curved projective structure on $N$) will attach the zero locus of $\tau$ back into $\mathbb{P}(\cT^*)$. The boundary $\p M$ from definition \ref{defi_1} will play a role of a submanifold
separating two open sets in $\mathbb{P}(\cT^*)$ which have $\tau>0$ and $\tau<0$ respectively. The method of the proof will be to show that near
the boundary ${\mathcal{Z}}(\tau)=0$ of $\ol{M}$ the metric 
(\ref{eq:coord_form}) can be put in the local normal form of theorem 
\ref{CGthm}.

%Before we state the theorem, we note that the Libermann connection $\nabla^{L}$ \cite{Lieb} associated to $(M,g,\Omega)$ is given by
%\be
%\label{lib}
%{\nabla^L}_a X_b={\nabla^{\bf g}}_a X_b-{G^c}_{ab} X_c,\quad \mbox{where}\quad
%{{G^c}_{ab}}=-{{\Omega}^{cd}}{\nabla^{\bf g}}_d {\Omega_{ab}}
%\ee
%and $\nabla^{\bf g}$ is the Levi--Civita connection of $g$.

%\mynote{Where do we use this? And is $G^c_{ab}$ Nijenhuis?}

%This connection is metric, has minimal torsion, and preserves the almost para--complex structure $J$. It thus belongs to a para--$c$--projective equivalence class which we will show to be compactifiable in the sense of definition \ref{defi_1}.

\begin{theo}
\label{our_thm}
The Einstein almost para--K\"ahler metric $(M, g, \Omega)$ given by 
(\ref{eq:coord_form}) admits a para--$c$--projective compactification
$\ol{M}$. The structure on the
$(2n-1)$--dimensional boundary $\p M\cong \mathbb{P}(T^* N)$ of $\ol{M}$ includes a contact structure together with a conformal structure 
and a para--CR structure
defined on the contact distribution.
\end{theo}
\mynote{Here we stated that $\p M\cong \mathbb{P}(T^* N)$ but I moved the comment about this to after the proof. I'm not sure where best to put it.}
\noindent
{\bf Proof.}
In the proof below we shall explicitly construct the boundary $\p M$ together with the contact structure and the associated conformal structure on the contact distribution. We shall
first deal with the model $M=SL(n+1)/GL(n)$, and then explain how the curvature
of $(N, [\nabla])$ modifies the compactification.

In the model case we can define coordinates $x^i$ on $N=\mathbb{RP}^n$ by taking $X=(1,x^1,\dots,x^n)$, where $(X^0,\dots,X^n)$ are homogeneous coordinates and we are working in an open set where $X^0\neq 0$. The ${x^i}$ are flat coordinates, so the connection components (and hence the Schouten tensor) vanish and (\ref{eq:coord_form}) reduces to
\be
\label{model_metric}
g=d\xi_i\odot dx^i + \xi_i\xi_jdx^i\odot dx^j, \qquad
\Omega=d \xi_i\wedge d x^i \quad
\mbox{where}\quad
i, j =1, \dots, n.
\ee
We can relate \cite{DM} the affine coordinates $\xi_i$ on the fibres of $T^*N$ to the tractor coordinates (\ref{eq:T*coords}) by setting $\xi_i=\mu_i/\tau$ on the complement of the zero locus ${\mathcal Z}(\tau)$ of $\tau$.
\mynote{In Rod's tractor bit my $\chi$ in (\ref{eq:T*coords}) was replaced by $\tau$. Are they the same thing? I though $\tau$ took values in a different density bundle?}

Now consider an open set  ${\mathcal U}\subset M$ given
by  $\xi_ix^i>0$, and define the function $T$ on ${\mathcal U}$ by
\be
\label{formula_for_T}
T=\frac{1}{\xi_i x^i}.
\ee
We shall attach a boundary  $\p \mathcal{U}$ to the open set $\mathcal{U}$ 
such that $T$ extends to a function $\ol{T}$ on $\mathcal{U}\cup \p \mathcal{U}$, and
$\ol{T}$ is  the defining function for this boundary.
We then investigate the geometry on $M$ in the limit $T\rightarrow 0$.
It is clear from above that
the zero locus of $\ol{T}$ will be contained in the zero locus $\mathcal{Z}(\tau)$ of $\tau$, and
therefore belongs to the boundary of $\ol{M}$. We will 
use $\ol{T}$ as a defining function for $\ol{M}$ in an open set $\ol{\mathcal{U}}\subset\ol{M}$.
The strategy of the proof is to extend $T$ to a coordinate system on 
$\mathcal{U}$, such that near the boundary the metric $g$ takes a form
as in Theorem \ref{CGthm}.


First define $\theta\in \Lambda^1(\ol{M})$ $\ov{M}$
by 
\be
\label{def_theta}
V\hook \theta=J(V)\hook d T, \quad\mbox{or equivalently}\quad 
\theta_a=\Omega_{ac}g^{bc}{{\nabla}^{\bf g}}_b T, \quad a, b, c=1, \dots, 2n
\ee
where $J$ is the para--complex structure of $(g,  \Omega)$. Using (\ref{model_metric}) this  gives
\[
\theta=2T(1-T)\xi_id x^i-dT.
\]
We need $n$  open sets $U_1, \dots, U_n$ such that $\xi_k\neq 0$ on $U_k$
to cover the zero locus of $T$. Here we chose $k=n$, and use
a coordinate system given by
\[
(T, Z_1, \dots, Z_{n-1}, X^1, \dots,
 X^{n-1}, Y),
\] 
where $T$ is
given by (\ref{formula_for_T}) and
\[
Z_A=\frac {\xi_A}{\xi_n}, \quad X^A=x^A, \quad Y=x^{n}, \quad\mbox{where}\quad
A=1, \dots, n-1.
\]
We compute
\[
\theta=2(1-T)\frac{dY+Z_AdX^A}{K}-dT, \quad
\xi_n=\frac{1}{KT}, \quad \mbox{where}\quad K\equiv Y+Z_AX^A,
\]
and substitute
\[
\xi_i dx^i=\frac{1}{KT}(dY+Z_AdX^A)
\]
into (\ref{model_metric}). This gives
\be
\label{CG_Form}
g=\frac{\theta^2-dT^2}{4T^2}+\frac{1}{T}h,
\ee
where 
\[
h=\frac{1}{4(1-T)}(\theta^2-dT^2)+\frac{1}{K}\Big(dZ_A\odot dX^A-\frac{1}{2(1-T)}X^A dZ_A\odot(\theta+dT)\Big)
\]
is regular at the boundary $T=0$. This is in agreement with the 
asymptotic form in Theorem \ref{CGthm} (see \cite{CG} for further details).

%Note that (\ref{def_theta}) defines the one form $\theta$ on the boundary $T=0$  only up to a overall multiple of a positive function.
The restriction $h$ to $\p M$ gives a metric on a distribution ${\mathcal D}=\mbox{Ker} (\theta|_{T=0})$
\be
\label{h000}
\theta|_{T=0}=2\frac{dY+Z_A dX^A}{Y+Z_AX^A}, \quad h_0=\frac{1}{4}{(\theta|_{T=0})}^2+\frac{1}{2(Y+Z_AX^A)}(2dZ_A\odot dX^A-X^AdZ_A\odot(\theta|_{T=0})).
\ee
 Note that $T$ is only defined up to multiplication by a positive function. Changing the defining function in this way results in a conformal rescalling of $\theta|_{T=0}$, thus the metric on the contact distribution is also defined up to an overall conformal scale. We shall choose the scale so that
the contact form is given  by $\theta_0\equiv K\theta|_{T=0}$ on $T(\p M)$,
with the metric on ${\mathcal D}$ given by
%\footnote{The singular denominator $K^{-1}$ may be avoided by adopting the Pfaff %coordinates
%\[
%y=\ln{(Y+Z_iX^i)}, \quad z_i=Z_i, \quad x_i=-\frac{X^i}{Y+Z_iX^i},
%\]
%which yields
%\[
%\theta_0=2(dy+x^idz_i), \quad h_{\mathcal D}=-(dx^i+x^idy)\odot dz_i.
%\]
%}
\be
\label{on_distri}
h_{\mathcal D}=dZ_A\odot dX^A.
\ee

We now move on to deal with the
curved case where the metric on $M$ is given by 
(\ref{main_metric}).
%g=\left(d\xi_a-\left(\Gamma_{ab}^c \xi_c- \xi_a\xi_b- \Rho_{ab}\right)\d %x^b\right)\odot \d x^a%
The coordinate system $(T, Z_A, X^A, Y)$ is as above, and
the one--form $\theta$ in (\ref{def_theta}) is given by
\[
\theta=2T(1-T)\xi_idx^i-dT+2T^2(\Rho_{ij}-\Gamma_{ij}^k\xi_k)x^idx^j,
\]
or in the $(T, Z_A, X^A, Y)$ coordinates,
\[
\begin{split}
\theta=\ 2&(1-T)\frac{Z_AdX^A+dY}{K} - dT \\
+& 2T^2\Bigg[\bigg(\Rho_{AB}-\frac{\Gamma^C_{AB}Z_C+\Gamma^n_{AB}}{TK}\bigg)X^AdX^B 
+\bigg(\Rho_{nB}-\frac{\Gamma^C_{nB}Z_C+\Gamma^n_{nB}}{TK}\bigg)YdX^B \\
+& \bigg(\Rho_{An}-\frac{\Gamma^C_{An}Z_C+\Gamma^n_{An}}{TK}\bigg)X^AdY 
+\bigg(\Rho_{nn}-\frac{\Gamma^C_{nn}Z_C+\Gamma^n_{nn}}{TK}\bigg)YdY\Bigg].
\end{split}
\]
%We find that $g$ in these coordinates is given by
%%\begin{split}
%g=
%\end{split}
%\]

Guided by the formula (\ref{CG_Form}) we define
\[
h=Tg-\frac{1}{4T}(\theta^2-dT^2),
\]
which we find to be
\be
\begin{split}
h=&
\frac{1}{4(1-T)}(\theta^2-dT^2)+\frac{1}{K}\Big(dZ_A\odot dX^A-\frac{1}{2(1-T)}
X^A dZ_A\odot (\theta+dT)\Big)\\
-&\frac{1}{K}\Big(
(\Gamma_{AB}^CZ_C+\Gamma_{AB}^n)dX^A\odot dX^B+
(\Gamma_{nn}^CZ_C+\Gamma_{nn}^n)dY\odot dY+
2(\Gamma_{An}^CZ_C+\Gamma_{An}^n)dX^A\odot dY\Big)\\
+&T(\Rho_{AB}dX^A\odot dX^B+2\Rho_{An}dX^A\odot dY+\Rho_{nn}dY\odot dY).
\end{split}
\ee
This is  smooth as $T\rightarrow 0$.

Restricting $h$ to $T=0$ yields a metric which differs from
(\ref{h000}) by the curved contribution given by the components of the  connection, but not the Schouten tensor. Substituting $dY=K\theta|_{T=0}/2-Z_AdX^A$, disregarding the terms involving $\theta|_{T=0}$ in $h$, and conformally rescalling by 
$K$ yields the metric
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{met_th}
h_{\mathcal D}&=&(dZ_A-\Theta_{AB}dX^B)\odot dX^A,\quad
\mbox{where}\\
\Theta_{AB}&=&\Gamma_{AB}^CZ_C+\Gamma_{AB}^n+
(\Gamma_{nn}^CZ_C+\Gamma_{nn}^n)Z_AZ_B-
2(\Gamma_{An}^CZ_C+\Gamma_{An}^n)Z_B\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
defined on the contact distribution ${\mathcal D}=\mbox{Ker}(\theta_0)$, 
where $\theta_0=2(dY+Z_AdX^A)$.

We now invoke Theorem \ref{CGthm},  verifying
by explicit computation that the remaining two conditions are satisfied. The first of these conditions is that the metric $h_{\mathcal{D}}$ is compatible with the  
Levi--form of the almost para--CR structure induced on $\p M$ by $J$, i.e.
\be
\label{boundary_compatibility}
h_{\mathcal D}(X, Y)=d\theta_0(JX, Y), \quad\mbox{for}\quad X\in\mathcal{D}.
\ee
The second is that the Nijenhuis tensor takes asymptotically tangential values, i.e. that (\ref{Nijenhuis_condition}) is satisfied.

Both of these follow from computing the para--complex structure $J$ in the $(T, Z_A, X^A, Y)$ coordinates. We find
\be
\begin{split}
\label{J_T=0}
J|_{T=0}=\ &-\frac{\p}{\p X^A}\otimes dX^A +\frac{\p}{\p Y}\otimes dY + \frac{\p}{\p Z_A} \otimes dZ_A + \frac{\p}{\p T}\otimes dT \\
&-\frac{Z_B}{K}\frac{\p}{\p T}\otimes dX^B - \frac{1}{K}\frac{\p}{\p T}\otimes dY \\
&-\big(\Gamma^D_{AB}Z_D+\Gamma^n_{AB}\big)\frac{\p}{\p Z_A} \otimes dX^B + \big(\Gamma^D_{nB}Z_D+\Gamma^n_{nB}\big)Z_C\frac{\p}{\p Z_C} \otimes dX^B \\
&-\big(\Gamma^D_{An}Z_D+\Gamma^n_{An}\big)\frac{\p}{\p Z_A} \otimes dY
+\big(\Gamma^D_{nn}Z_D+\Gamma^n_{nn}\big)Z_C\frac{\p}{\p Z_C} \otimes dY.
\end{split}
\ee
Restricting to vectors in $\mathcal{D}$ amounts to substituting $dY=\theta_0/2-Z_AdX^A$ and disregarding the terms involving $\theta_0$ as above, so that
\[
\begin{split}
J|_{\mathcal{D}}= &-\frac{\p}{\p X^A}\otimes dX^A +Z_A\frac{\p}{\p Y}\otimes dX^A + \frac{\p}{\p Z_A} \otimes dZ_A + \frac{\p}{\p T}\otimes dT \\
&-\frac{2Z_B}{K}\frac{\p}{\p T}\otimes dX^B -\Theta_{AB}\frac{\p}{\p Z_A}\otimes dX^B
\end{split}
\]
and (\ref{boundary_compatibility}) is satisfied.

For the Nijenhuis condition, we use the formula (\ref{eq:Nijenhuis_index_def}). Note that we need only consider components of this with $a=T$, and thus only need to work with the $\p/\p T$ components of $J$ to find the terms which look like $\p J$. This is a one--form which we shall call $J^{(T)}$ and find to be
\[
\begin{split}
J^{(T)}=&\bigg(-\frac{Z_B}{K} + \frac{T[2Z_B + (\Gamma^D_{AB}Z_D+\Gamma^n_{AB})X^A + (\Gamma^D_{nB}Z_D+\Gamma^n_{nB})Y]}{K} - T^2[\Rho_{AB}X^A+\Rho_{nB}Y]\bigg)dX^B \\
&\bigg(-\frac{1}{K} + \frac{T[2 + (\Gamma^D_{An}Z_D+\Gamma^n_{An})X^A + (\Gamma^D_{nn}Z_D+\Gamma^n_{nn})Y]}{K} - T^2[\Rho_{An}X^A+\Rho_{nn}Y]\bigg)dY.
\end{split}
\]
Note that this agrees with (\ref{J_T=0}) when $T=0$. We use it to calculate ${\mathcal{N}^{a}}_{bc}\nabla_a T$, dropping terms which vanish when $T=0$ to verify (\ref{Nijenhuis_condition}).

%The only non--vanising components of the torsion of the Libermann connection (\ref{lib}) on
%the boundary $\p M$ are tangential to $\p M$,
% i. e.
%\[
%\Big({G^{a}}_{bc}{\nabla^{\bf g}}_a T\Big)|_{T=0}=0.
%\]
%The statement now follows as for the Liberman connection  (\ref{lib}) the Nijenhuis tensor is a constant multiple of $G_{ab}^c$.

\subsection{Two--dimensional projective structures}
In the case if $n=2$ the coordinates on $\p M$ are $(X, Y, Z)$,  and (\ref{met_th}) yields
\[
h_{\mathcal D}=dZ\odot dX-[\Gamma_{11}^2+(\Gamma_{11}^1-2\Gamma_{12}^2)Z+(\Gamma_{22}^2-2\Gamma_{12}^2)Z^2+
\Gamma_{22}^1Z^3]dX\odot dX,
\]
which is transparently invariant under the projective changes 
\[
\Gamma_{ij}^k\longrightarrow \Gamma_{ij}^k+\delta^k_i\Upsilon_j+\delta^k_j\Upsilon_i
\]
of $\nabla$.
In the  two-dimensional case the 
projective
structures $(N, [\nabla])$ are equivalent to second order ODEs which are cubic in
the first derivatives (see, e.g. \cite{BDE})
\begin{equation}
\label{ODE}
\frac{d^2 Y}{d X^2}=\Gamma^1_{22}\Big(\frac{d Y}{d X}\Big)^3
+(2\Gamma^1_{12}-\Gamma^2_{22})\Big(\frac{d Y}{d X}\Big)^2
+(\Gamma^1_{11}-2\Gamma^2_{12})\Big(\frac{d Y}{d X}\Big)-
\Gamma^2_{11},

where the integral curves of (\ref{ODE}) are the unparametrised geodesics of $\nabla$. 
The integral curves $C$ of $(\ref{ODE})$ are integral submanifolds
of a  differential
ideal ${\mathcal I}=<\theta_0, \theta_1>$, where
\[
\theta_0=dY+ZdX, \quad \theta_1=dZ-\Big(\Gamma_{11}^2+(\Gamma_{11}^1-2\Gamma_{12}^2)Z+(\Gamma_{22}^2-2\Gamma_{12}^1)Z^2+
\Gamma_{22}^1Z^3\Big)dX
\]
are one--forms on a three--dimensional manifold $B=\PP(T^*N)$ with local coordinates $(X, Y, Z)$. If $f:C\rightarrow B$ is an immersion, then $f^*(\theta_0)=0, f^*(\theta_1)=0$ is equivalent
to (\ref{ODE}) as long as $\theta_2\equiv dX$ does not vanish. In terms of these three one--forms
the contact structure, and the metric on the contact distribution are given by
$
\theta_0,  h_{\mathcal D}=\theta_1\odot\theta_2.

\subsection{Why is $(M,g,\Omega)$ para--$c$--projectively compact?}
Note that by construction in section \ref{sec:trac_construction} it is easily verified that the zero locus of $\tau$ is a smoothly embedded hypersurface in $\mathcal{M}$,  and from (\ref{eq:T*sequence}) it follows at once that this may be identified with the total space of the fibrewise projectivisation $\mathbb{P}(T^*N)$ (which is well known to have a para-CR structure).

It would be possible to show that the structures $(M,g\Omega)$ arising in the projective to Einstein correspondence are para--$c$--projectively compact using a tractor approach. By our construction above it follows that $\mathcal{M}$ has a canonical para-c-projective geometry. In the notation as above, $\pi^*{\cT}\oplus
\pi^*{\cT^*}$ is the corresponding para-c-projective tractor bundle
and this has a canonical tractor connection that trivially
extends (in fibre directions) the pull back of the projective
connection (that is available in horizontal directions). The
dual pairing between $\pi^*{\cT}$ and $\pi^*{\cT^*}$ determines a
fibre metric and compatible symplectic form on the bundle
$\pi^*{\cT}\oplus \pi^*{\cT^*}$ and this is obviously preserved by the
connection. What remains is to show that the tractor connection so
constructed satisfies properties that mean that it is {\em normal} in
the sense defined in e.g.\ \cite{CS-book}. With this established then
the main results then follow from the general holonomy theory in
\cite{CGH-duke}.


\section{The model via an orbit decomposition}

\mynote{Not really sure what to do with this section. It seems only to show $g$ is Einstein without having to explicitly calculate its Ricci tensor, otherwise I think it's pretty much equivalent to the general construction in the intro?}

In this section we describe here the flat (in the sense of parabolic
geometries) model \cite{CDT13, DM} of our construction in tractor
terms.

The flat projective structure on $N=\RP^n$ gives rise to 
the neutral signature para--K\"ahler Einstein metric on $M=SL(n+1)/GL(n)$
\be
\label{DM_metric}
g=d\xi_i\odot dx^i+(\xi_i dx^i)^2, \quad \Omega= d\xi_i\wedge dx^i, \quad\mbox{where}\quad
i, j, \dots =1, \dots, n.
\ee
In \cite{DM}, \S 7.1 it was explained how this homogeneous model
corresponds to the projectivised co-tractor bundle of $\RP^n$, with
an $\RP_{n-1}$ removed from each $\RP_n$ fiber. This $\RP_{n-1}$
corresponds to incident pairs of points and hyperplanes in $\R^{n+1}\times\R_{n+1}$.


Here we shall instead take $N$ to be the sphere $S^n$ with its standard
projective structure as this is orientable in all dimensions and, more
importantly, on this (double cover of $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^n$) the
tractor bundle is trivial, and this simplifies the discussion.  The
underlying space of the (compactified) model of dimension $2n$ is
$S^n\times S_n$ where both $S_n$ and $S^n$ denote spheres that are
dual as we shall explain.

Consider first two vector spaces each isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$:
$$
V\cong \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \qquad \mbox W \cong \mathbb{R}^{n+1}
$$
and view each as a representation space for an $SL(n+1,\mathbb{R})$
action.  So $G:= SL(V)\times SL(W)$ acts on $V\times W$. (Note that we may
wlog consider $V$ and $W$ as respectively the $\pm 1$ eigenspaces of
the single vector space $\mathbb{V}:=V\oplus W$ equipped with a
$\mathbb{J}$ s.t. $\mathbb{J}^2=1$.)

Now the action of $SL(V)$ descends to a transitive action on the ray
projectivisation $\mathbb{P}_+(V)$ and similarly $SL(W)$ acts
transitively on $\mathbb{P}_+(W)$. Thus  $G:= SL(V)\times SL(W)$ acts transitively on the manifold
$$
{\mathcal M}:= \mathbb{P}_+(V) \times \mathbb{P}_+(W).
$$
We can represent an element of $\mathcal{M}$ in terms of pairs of homogeneous coordinates
$([Y],[Z])$ where $0\neq Y\in V$ and $0\neq Z\in W$.

Note that as a smooth manifold $\mathcal{M}=S^n\times S^n$, but as a homogeneous manifold it is
$$
G/P = \big( SL(V)/P_X \big)\times \big( SL(W)/P_U \big)
$$
where $P_X$ (resp.\ $P_U$) is the parabolic subgroup in $SL(V)$
that stabilises a point $[X]$ in $\mathbb{P}_+(V)$ (resp.\ $[U] \in \mathbb{P}_+(W)$
), and $P$ is the group product $P_X\times P_W$ which itself is a
parabolic subgroup of the semisimple group $G$.

Now introduce an additional structure which breaks the $G$
symmetry. 
Namely we fix an isomorphism
$$
I:W\to V^*
$$
where $V^*$ denotes the dual space to $V$. The subgroup $H\cong SL(n+1,\mathbb{R})$ of $G$
that fixes this may be identified with $SL(V)$ which acts on a pair
$(Y,Z)\in V\times V^*$ by the defining representation and on the first
factor and by the dual representation on the second factor.

Given this structure we may now (suppress $I$ and) view ${\mathcal{M}}$ as
consisting of pairs $([X],[U])$ where $0\neq X\in V$ and $0\neq U\in
V^*$. That is 
$$
{\mathcal{M}}= \mathbb{P}_+(V) \times \mathbb{P}_+(V^*).
$$

This is useful as follows: Each element $[U]$ in
$\mathbb{P}_+(V^*)$ determines an oriented  hyperplane in $V$ and each $[X]\in
\mathbb{P}_+(V)$ an oriented line in $V$.  So now we consider the $H$
action on $M$. This has two open orbits and a closed orbit. The last
is the incidence space 
$$
\mathcal{Z}=\{ ([X],[U])\in \mathcal{M} \mid U(X)=0 \} 
$$
which sits as smooth orientable separating hypersurface in $\mathcal{M}$. Then there are the open orbits
$$
M_+=\{ ([X],[U])\in \mathcal{M} \mid U(X)>0 \} \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad
M_-=\{ ([X],[U])\in \mathcal{M} \mid U(X)<0 \}.
$$
We may think of $\mathcal{Z}$ as the `boundary' (at infinity) for the open orbits $M_\pm$.

We now describe the geometries on the orbits. The claim is that there
are Einstein metrics in $M_\pm$, while $\mathcal{Z}$ is well known as
the model for so-called contact Langrangian (or sometimes called
para--CR) geometry, this is a real analogue of hypersurface type CR
geometry.

First observe that $N_V:=\mathbb{P}_+(V)$
is the flat model of projective
geometry. So in particular we have
$$
0\to \ce_V(-1)\stackrel{X}{\to}\cT_V\to TN_V(-1)\to 0
$$
where $\cT_V$ is the projective tractor bundle on $N_V$ and $X$ is the
tautological section of $\cT(1)$, which coincides with the canonical tractor.
Similarly there a sequence on
$N^W:= \mathbb{P}_+(V^*)$
\begin{equation}\label{useful}
0\to \ce^W(-1)\stackrel{U}{\to}\cT^W \to TN^W(-1)\to 0 .
\end{equation}

There is a natural tractor bundle $\mathcal{T}:=\cT_V\oplus \cT^W $ on $M$. 
Where $X$ and $U$ are not incident this induces a metric on $M$ as
follows. Observe that, at a point $([X],[U])$ where $X\hook U \neq 0$, the  tractor field  $U$ splits the first sequence by $\nu\in \Gamma (\ce(-1,0))$ defined by
$$
\nu:=U/\tau
$$
with $\tau:=X\hook U$ (and where we have used an obvious weight
notation). This follows as $X\hook \nu=1$. Similarly
$$
x:=X/\tau \in \Gamma (\ce(0,-1))
$$
splits the second short exact sequence because $x \hook U=1$. Thus we
obtain a neutral signature metric on $TN_V\oplus TN^W$ by these
two steps: First, using  these splittings yields a bundle
monomorphism
$$
TN_V(-1,0)\oplus TN^W(0,-1) \to \cT_V\oplus \cT^W .
$$ Second, this gives a symmetric form $\boldsymbol{g}$ and symplectic form
$\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ on $TN_V(-1,0)\oplus TN^W(0,-1)$ by then using
the canonical metric and symplectic form on $\cT_V\oplus \cT^W $ given
by the duality of $\cT_V$ and $ \cT^W$. Thus $\boldsymbol{g}\in \Gamma
(S^2T^*M(1,1))$ and $\boldsymbol{\Omega}\in \Gamma
(\Lambda^2T^*M(1,1))$. Then set
$$ g:=\frac{1}{\tau}\boldsymbol{g} \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad  \Omega:=\frac{1}{\tau}\boldsymbol{\Omega}.
$$
The metric $g$ is easily seen to have neutral signature.  It is
Einstein because the tractor metric on $\mathcal{T}$ is parallel for the
tractor connection (see \cite{CGH-duke} for the analogous c-projective
case). The tractor connecction arises from the usual parallel transport on the
vector space $V\oplus V^*$ viewed as an affine manifold.
