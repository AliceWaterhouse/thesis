\begin{acknowledgements}      

The work in this thesis would not have been possible without the ideas, enthusiasm and sense of humour of my supervisor, Maciej Dunajski. I offer him my sincere thanks for his patience and guidance over the last three years. Additionally, I would like to thank Rod Gover, Nick Manton, Thomas Mettler, Paul Tod and Paul Townsend for interesting discussions and helpful suggestions.

Thanks are also due to the Japesters for Japes; to Jonny, Philip and Chris H for always making B2.12 a good place to be; to Jack for a fantastic adventure; and to the rest of the pav B gang for clarifying the technical difference between a fruit and a vegetable.

I express my deepest gratitude to my parents, Angie and Tim, for their sturdy and ever--present support; to Esther, for making me the person I am today; and to Cherish, without whom I may not have made it to this point in my PhD. Finally, I would like to thank Chris, for laughs, companionship and his unending loyalty.
